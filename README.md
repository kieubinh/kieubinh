### Hi there,

My name is **Thanh Binh (Anthony) Kieu**. I currently live in Sydney, New South Wales.

I am a seasoned information technology professional with a strong background in academic instruction, research, and project management. With over **5 years of experience as an assistant lecturer at Vietnam National University Hanoi, University of Engineering and Technology**, and **a PhD degree in Information Systems from University of Technology, Sydney**. During my PhD program, I have developed a deep understanding of the intricacies of data analysis and information technology. After graduation, I found my **new passion for sales analysis and project management**, and have gained practical experience in these areas while working as **a part-time sales assistant** and **a digital project manager** at BMSYDNEY in Sydney, Australia. Through these roles, I have gained valuable skills in identifying trends and patterns, developing strategies, and delivering successful projects.

Now, I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set to transition into a role as a business analyst, where I can utilize my expertise in data analysis and project management to help organizations make informed decisions and achieve their goals. I am confident that my strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and ability to communicate complex information in a clear and concise manner would make me a valuable asset to any team.
