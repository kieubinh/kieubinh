### Hi there,

My name is **Thanh Binh (Anthony) Kieu**. I currently live in Sydney, New South Wales.

I am a seasoned information technology professional with a strong background in academic instruction, research, and project management with over **5 years of experience as an assistant lecturer at Vietnam National University Hanoi, University of Engineering and Technology**, and **a PhD degree in Information Systems from University of Technology, Sydney**. During my PhD program, I have developed a deep understanding of the intricacies of data analysis and information technology. After graduation, I found my **new passion for sales analysis and project management**, and have gained practical experience in these areas while working as **a part-time sales assistant** and **a business analyst** at BMSYDNEY in Sydney, Australia. Through these roles, I have gained valuable skills in identifying trends and patterns, developing strategies, and delivering successful projects.
