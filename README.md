### Hi there,

My name is **Thanh Binh (Anthony) Kieu**. I currently live in Sydney, New South Wales.

I am a seasoned information technology professional with a strong background in academic instruction and research with over **5 years of experience as an assistant lecturer at Vietnam National University Hanoi, University of Engineering and Technology** that is one of the most famous universities in Vietnam, and then I've got **a PhD degree in Information Systems from University of Technology, Sydney**. During my PhD program, I have developed a deep understanding of natural language processing using machine learning techniques with applications of recommender systems. After graduation, I have been working as a **data analyst** at BMSYDNEY in Sydney, Australia which is a company with over 20 years of distribution of building products in NSW. Through these roles, I have gained valuable skills in identifying trends and patterns, developing strategies, and delivering successful projects.
